Feels like The Loranes have been around forever. Wasn't that the band touring with Bill Haley? Didn't they support The Beatles back then at Star Club or did they open for Velvet at Max's Kansas City before they played with The Pistols, Nirvana, Oasis and BRMC?

Sounds familiar to some really cool dad's record collection, but then again - when the needle touches their vinyl, it will get you because it sounds new, fresh and unique.

It’s hard to believe that the Trio from Berlin is a new band since the bass player's name is Mammut and as an ex-member of the band Kadavar, he has kind of been taking part at Berlin's music scene forever since.
Music wise The Loranes have nothing to do with his last band, except that they are also into vintage stuff. It’s about Rock music – you can find their sound somewhere between Garage-Rock, Neo-Heavy-Blues and Psychedelic. But besides all the heavy distortion, the melodies are what gets stuck in your head, like one of those songs you won't ever get rid of. Scary Pop, dark and rough.

The Loranes met about one year ago in october 2014. In spring 2015 the label H42 from Hamburg released their first 7” vinyl. Lots of gigs followed until now. In October The Loranes will release their first album „Trust“ which was recorded and produced by themselves and will be released on Noisolution Records. It’s fuzzy, rough and literally smells like basement and glowing tube amps! 

No wonder the label decided to send them on a Europe Tour to support the Picturebooks: 23 shows in 8 different countries.
